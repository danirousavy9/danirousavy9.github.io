<h2> One Direction Lyrics </h2>
<p>"Live While We're Young"

[Liam:]
Hey girl I'm waiting on ya, I'm waiting on ya
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the windows down

[Zayn:]
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool and we know it too (know it too)
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

[All:]
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (and live while we're young)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight let's get some

[Harry:]
And live while we're young

[Zayn:]
Hey girl it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't overthink, just let it go
And if we get together, yeah get together
Don't let the pictures leave your phone (oh oh)

[Niall:]
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

[All]
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (wanna live while we're young)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight let's get some

[Harry:]
And live while we're young

[Zayn:]
And girl, you and I
We're about to make some memories tonight

[Louis:]
I wanna live while we're young
We wanna live while we're young

[All:]
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

Crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

Wanna live, wanna live, wanna live while we're young
(C'mon, young) wanna live, wanna live (wanna live while we're young)
Wanna live, wanna live, wanna live while we're young
Tonight let's get some

[Zayn:]
And live while we're young


"One Thing"

[Liam:]
I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race

[Harry:]
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

[Zayn:]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

[Niall:]
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night

[Louis:]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

[Harry:]
You've got that one thing

[Liam:]
Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

[Chorus:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind (out of my mind)
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
Yeah, you've got that one thing

Play "I Want"
on Amazon Music
"I Want"

[Harry]
Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

[Harry]
You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
When girls say...

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Liam]
You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say...

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Louis]
Oh, and all the girls say…

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Zayn]
Be loved by you
I wanna, I’ll stay true
I wonder if you knew
What you put me through
But you want, you want, you want me to love you too

[Liam]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

[Zayn]
Oh, and all the girls say…

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Harry]
And all the girls say
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Zayn]
And that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
To be loved by you"Over Again"

Said I'd never leave her
Cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that made my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low
Since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Again we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she'll say
If I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute
You know I can tell that your heart isn't in it, or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip (yeah)
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
"More Than This"

[Liam:]
Ooh
I'm broken, do you hear me?
I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see,
I'm dancin' alone, I'm praying,
That your heart will just turn around,

And as I walk up to your door,
My head turns to face the floor,
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say,

[Harry:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,
Can love you more than this

[Niall:]
If I'm louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down
In my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are the same
You save me,
When you leave it's gone again,

[Louis:]
And then I see you on the street,
In his arms, I get weak,
My body fails, I'm on my knees
Prayin',

[All:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,

[Zayn:]
Yeah, I've never had the words to say,
But now I'm askin' you to stay
For a little while inside my arms,
And as you close your eyes tonight,
I pray that you will see the light,
That's shining from the stars above,

(And I say)

[Liam:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,

[Zayn]
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

[All]
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down,
I might just die inside (I'm broken)
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,
Can love you more than this
